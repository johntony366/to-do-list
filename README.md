# To do list

### Simple to do list app that uses local storage to save data. Built using webpack with vanilla html, css and javascript.

This project could have been much easier and quicker to finish had I used a framework like React. However, using vanilla html, css and javascript helped solidifiy the core concepts and build an understanding of what goes on under the hood.
